# brunch-with-ember-sideloaded#
This repo is meant to be used as [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for developing [Ember](http://emberjs.com) applications based on the official Ember [Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit/archive/master.zip).

But first, a little history ... in the beginning there was `brunch-with-ember`, then there was `brunch-with-ember-reloaded` (written by [@gcollazo](https://github.com/gcollazo/brunch-with-ember-reloaded)), and then I came round and decided that I wasn't cool enough to use CoffeeScript so I've forked and modified my way to `brunch-with-ember-sideloaded` which takes @gcollazo's great skeleton and makes it JavaScript focused and also replaces `Stylus` with `Less`. So ... if you're eager to try out Ember but don't want to tackle CoffeeScript just yet, this might be your skeleton. 


## Demo
Demo application to come soon.

## Versions

## Getting started

```
brunch new git@github.com:ksnyde/brunch-with-ember-sideloaded.git <appname> 
cd <appname>
bower install
brunch watch -s
```
Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) on your browser.

## Dependency Automation ##
There are two ways that external depencies to your Ember app can be kept up-to-date. The Ember specific dependencies (aka, Ember, Ember-Data, and Handlebars) are still kept current by using the `cake` automation described below. All other vendor dependencies are now managed by `Bower`. This seperation is only due to the fact that Ember is still in a very actively changed state and therefore the frequency with which you may be updating the two types of dependencies will vary. I will likely change all depenencies to use the `Bower` package manager at some future points and am open to people comments on this.

### Ember Updates ###
There's a  cake task to download the Ember and Ember Data from [builds.emberjs.com](http://builds.emberjs.com) and copy it to your `vendor/scripts` directory.

```
cake getember						→ get latest build of core Ember
cake getemberdata					→ get latest build of Ember-Data
```

The version of handlebars that works with Ember seems to be a bit sensitive at the moment so for now this is still manual (currently using RC4). Will definately look for a better solution going forward and open to any ideas folks have.

### Bower Integration ###
As of this version of the skeleton there is integration with the [Bower](http://bower.io) package manager. To use this you must make sure you have a recent version of brunch -- just type `npm install -g brunch` and you'll get the latest version -- and then have Bower installed which is achieved with `npm install -g bower`. Once that is done you're all set to take all the benefits of Bower. The key commands you'll be interested in are:

```
bower list			will list all of the Bower depenencies and what version they are on (including a reference to possible upgrades where applicable)
bower clear-cache	this will clear the Bower cache and the specified package caches (and is the first step in a update)
bower update		this will update all the dependencies to the latest version that meets the dependency rules in the `bower.json` file
```

#### Bower Modules ####
The specific modules and versions are listed above in the "versions" section.



## Generators ##
This skeleton makes use of [scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme) generators to help you create common files quicker. To use first install skaffolt globally with `npm install -g scaffolt`. Then you can use the following command to generate files.

```
scaffolt model <name> 				→ app/models/			Name.coffee
scaffolt view <name>				→ app/views/			NameView.coffee
scaffolt controller <name> 			→ app/controllers/		NameController.coffee
scaffolt arraycontroller <name>		→ app/controllers/		NamesController.coffee
scaffolt route <name> 				→ app/routes/			NameRoute.coffee
scaffolt template <name> 			→ app/templates			name.hbs
```
There's a few more commands you can use with scaffolt and also instruction on how to create your own generators, so make sure you check out the [docs](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt#readme).

### Testing
You can write your tests in the `test` folder, just make sure they are named `*_test.coffee`. You can customize the test to user PhantomJS, Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera on the `test/karma.conf.js` file. There's a lot of other settings there as well. Run tests with:

```
cake test
```
